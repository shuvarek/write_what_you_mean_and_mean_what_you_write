In the room 32 at Asholean museum which cover Indian art from years 600 to 1900 an interesting sculpture can be found. It is goddess Sidha which reminds me mother earth, full of love and devoted to care about her children. Her big breast and big hands can catch your attention first but then you let the details of this work impress you more.
We live in masculine world dominated by power, conquest and exploitation. Soldiers, dictators, they are the monuments which we praise most. Or we look at posters which prostitute us selling sex and other products. But the love and care have no value as they cannot be sold. This sculpture remains me that there is other world. World not for sale, which do not exploit but care. Maybe is a spark of the an old civilisation which has passed leaving only its some symbols which we should interpret or is it just my longing and imagination?
Whatever it may be, go and look at this sculptures impress your own imagination, maybe you would explore something buried for long in your own soul.
