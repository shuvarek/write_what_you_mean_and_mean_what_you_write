profound

I would like to write a poem, but yet don't know how
can you help me with my struggle, so it can be done
I am struggling, I am fighting, losing all my hope
If I do not finish writing, I will buy a rope

Is there any muse, who would help me choose
All the words which needed to be boiled
down the pot of my imaginetion
push me forward to my own creation

I tell wyou what, forget the pot, let me freewerse this
Becase I am no more a slave, of a conventios,
Let me be free living person.
