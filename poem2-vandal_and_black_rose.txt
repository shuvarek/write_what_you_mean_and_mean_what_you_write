Vandal and Black Rose

At the town of valicious, middle in the night
The earth was trembling by the fierce vandals tribe
All the building were ruined, and the flames eat their rests
This is how started barbarian conquest

Perfection in sculptures and beauty of stones
Has no values for vandal bloody crazy drones
Only the sound of metal or gold
can fulfil they [spragniony] thirsty soul
